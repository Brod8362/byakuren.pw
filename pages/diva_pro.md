DIVA Pro Review

## Forenote

This was originally going to be a video I made reviewing the DIVA Pro. While making that video isn't entirely off of the table yet, I realized that I'm lazy and probably won't get around to it anytime soon. Thus, I figured I may as well just post it here.

This was intended to be a script, so sometimes it's written in a more script-like format as opposed to a blog. I don't feel like editing it, so you get what you get.

Enjoy!

## Intro

Hi, this is my somewhat-structured review of the ZhouSensor DIVA Pro. Before I get to anything, I want to say that I purchased this product with my own money, and all of the thoughts are my own. I am going to attempt to share every little thing that I've thought while playing with this controller, cover the pros, cons, and observations, and at the end talk about potential alternatives.

I will say, please try to watch the entire thing if you're seriously considering buying this - it's easy to take things out of context if you don't watch the full video. This video isn't monetized or anything, I just want to give potential buyers the most honest and accurate depicition of this that I can before they commit to spending a lot on a niche product like this. 

## Pricing
So let's tackle the obvious parts first. This controller costs just about $400 - which is a lot. Of course, these kinds of things are for enthusiasts, you'd only want to buy this if you KNOW you're a huge DIVA fan and enjoy playing on arcade.

The final cost for mine came about to about $460 - $400 for the controller, and $60ish for shipping from China via DHL. From the date of purchase to it arriving at my front door, it was about two weeks, but it's worth noting that most of that time it wasn't even in DHL's hands. As soon as DHL got ahold of it, it was at my door in four days. I can definitely recommend opting for DHL in the US if you decide to buy this controller, but your mileage may vary.

As far as actually buying it goes, your best bet is YubiParts.com. This store is run by one guy, Tim, and he's super helpful and friendly, and strives himself on his customer service. I have no affiliation with YubiParts, but I can highly recommend buying from them. 

## Review
So, let's move onto the controller itself. And I have to say - I love this thing. Having played in a real arcade cabinet, I can confidently say that this will at a bare minimum meet that bar. The size of the play area is the same, so all of the buttons and the slider are going to be at the exact same place you'd expect them to be if you were playing on a real cabinet. I *feel* like the buttons on the DIVA Pro are taller and "rounder", if that makes sense, but I haven't bothered to verify that claim.

### Buttons
Speaking of the buttons, one obvious downside of the DIVA Pro is that the buttons are *extremely* loud - have a listen: (clip of me smacking buttons)

It *is* possible to play somewhat quietly if you're not hitting them too hard, but don't count on it. As soon as you get into higher BPM songs with more action, you're going to be hitting them hard whether you want to or not. If noise level is a concern, I cannot recommend this controller.

But, while we're talking about the buttons, let's cover what is perhaps the biggest selling point of the DIVA Pro - there are *no microswitches* on the buttons. Now, I'm not really all that into arcade cabinets as a whole, I am no expert on the average lifespan of microswitches how long they'll last. But, on this controller, that is completely irrelevant, you cannot wear out something that doesn't exist.

Instead of microswitches, this controller uses adjustable optical sensors. You can actually *adjust* the sensitivity of each of your buttons individually, which is extremely cool. The process is documented in the manual, so I'm not going to get super into it here, but the gist of it you can enter  settings mode and use the slider as a way to adjust the sensitivity. 

As you can see here, I've set triangle to trigger at maximum depth, and I've set square to trigger at the slightest push - you can see when they "trigger" when the light goes off. And if I push on them at the same time, you can see square triggers *way* earlier than triangle does. This is an awesome feature for players to fine-tune their play to however they want. I've found that I prefer my sensitivity somewhere in the middle, which is not what I was expecting. I was definitely expecting to prefer it heavier.

Final notes about the buttons - the clear part of them spins. Real cabinets don't do this, and while it's not really a big deal, *very* occasionally I find myself slipping on the buttons while playing, and they're just spinning instead of being pressed. Again, though, not a big deal, it doesn't happen very often. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the texture of them - they just feel kind of cheap? I don't really know how to put it, but it doesn't feel like a super high quality plastic. To me, at least. Just remember that I'm not an arcade cabinet expert so I'm just sharing my raw thoughts on them.

### Slider
Ok, enough about the buttons, what about the slider? To be honest, the slider is pretty much half the reason I bought this. And, I think it's my favorite part of this controller - it is *without a doubt*, better than a real cabinet by miles. And the reason is simple - this slider is perfectly smooth to your fingers. If you've ever played on a real Future Tone cab, then you know that the slider is glossy, and there's a not insignificant amount of friction on your fingers. If you're playing at a high level or just playing for long enough, your fingers will be rubbed raw and it's going to hurt.

This is 100% *eliminated* on the DIVA Pro - the slider is made of a matte acrylic, and it's perfectly smooth to the touch. I could swipe my fingers on this all day and I won't feel a thing. It's absolutely amazing and I cannot state enough how much I love this slider surface. 

The sliders are also very accurate, I rarely have any isssues with it in game, and typically if I miss a note it's entirely my fault.

There is one minor flaw with my unit (I'm not really sure if this is a flaw) but sometimes it thinks there's touch on the very leftmost segment of the slider, and the only way to get that to go away is to unplug the controller and plug it back in. This isn't really even a problem, because it doesn't impact gameplay even if it's there, but its just something I observed and felt I should mention.

### Lighting
Now, when you talk about the slider, you must also talk about the RGB lighting. I'm not typically a fan of RGB, in fact, I went out of my way to not have any in my PC. But, I'll be honest, I'm kind of a sucker for the rainbow puke of this controller. You can configure the slider to be a rainbow cycle like this, *OR* you can set it to a static color. You can also adjust the segment size of the rainbow cycling, so it can either occupy the entire slider, or be a more traditional rainbow.

You can also adjust per-button lighting, of both the resting and depressed state. I have mine set to just turn off when pressed, but you can set it to whatever you'd like.

If you don't like the lighting, then you can just turn it off - no biggie. But, I like it, so I plan on leaving it on.

### Build Quality
Now, before I get into the build quality section, I want to point something out - *these are handmade products.*

Sure, the casing is made and painted in a factory, but everything else is hand-assembled to my knowledge. That means there may be minor imperfections or other flaws, and *you should expect that*. If that would bother you, just don't buy this controller. Yes, I understand it's very expensive, but you need to also have realistic expectations of what just one guy and his business partner(s) can do, and be willing to treat the potential minor flaws with love.

Now with that said - how is the build quality? I would say it's pretty good. The case is sturdy and rigid, and that feels great. The paint *seems* like it has a little bit of orange peel, but that not really an issue and doesn't bother me.

My unit had a little bit of dust inside some of the buttons - I could fix this myself if I cared, but its such a minor issue and doesn't bother me so I just left it alone. You could call it part of the character.

One thing that I *can't* fix, is the dust that's stuck just underneath the label. This graphic on the top here isn't paint, it's a white label on top of the paint, and there's quite a bit of dust stuck around the edges which you can see. I'll try to remember to put some pictures up on the screen.

This is somewhat of a shame but again, doesn't bother me that much. These are simply artifacts of a hand-built product, and I immediately forget all of it the second I start playing and having fun.

Other than the things I listed above, this thing is pretty much just a solid metal box - fairly heavy, mind you, about 8 pounds IIRC - and thankfully held together with screws and fasteners instead of glue. As a side-effect of the screws and fasteners, you can somewhat see the outlines of the interior screw posts from the outside - I'll put a picture up on screen now. This is fine to me, because I would take this anyday over having something held together with adhesive and forgotten dreams.

### Software Suggestions
So, onto some minor software gripes. Well, I wouldn't say gripes per-se, just suggestions that I would like to see implemented.

1. First, I would like to have the option to *disable* the front button lockout. I actually really like the feature - the idea is the front touch-sensitive buttons are disabled after a brief period so you don't accidentally hit them during play. You can re-enable them by just pressing and holding any one for one second. This is an awesome feature, but it can make menus a real chore - for example pausing in the middle of a song to reset, or going back to your marker in practice mode. It's not a dealbreaker for me, because I'm playing on PC, so I have my keyboard right here and can just use that. But, playing on PS4 or Switch, I could see how this could get annoying and even be a dealbreaker. Because of the way I play, there's no risk of me accidentally bumping the buttons, so it would be nice if I could turn this feature off.
2. Second - If you've played a real cabinet, you may know that you can use the very last bits of the touch slider - the L/R here, to scroll up and down in the song list. I would love if you could do that on this controller. Because of the aforementioned button lockout issue, it means scrolling through the song list right after a song can be a minor inconvenience, so having the ability to just use the ends of the slider for it would be fantastic. All you'd need to do is map them to up/down on the D-pad or joystick and that would be that. A small feature, but would be a huge quality of life improvement for me.
3. Third - and also related to the slider - it would be nice if we could get analog slider support on MegaMix+ for PC. I've heard that some of this is an issue on the game side and not on the controller side, so I don't know for sure. It could also be that because I'm playing on Linux through proton, it just wouldn't be possible. But, it would be an awesome feature to get that full arcade-slider experience, because as it is right now, sliders are too easy because it's treated as if you're pressing the triggers. Again, though, this might not be something ZhouSensor can do anything about, so just please keep that in mind. Honestly, if ZhouSensor was willing to work with me, I'd be willing to put in the work to attempt to figure out and see if it's possible to mod the game to add this functionality, it would be really awesome. If you're out there, ZhouSensor, hit me up.

And real quick, on the topic of software - this controller supports PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. There are two separate ports on the back - one for PC/Nintendo Switch, and one for PS4. 
It's most likely because I'm on Linux, but I find using the PS4 port works best for me - even though you're supposed to use the PC port when playing on PC. Supposely, on Windows, the PS4 port has issues with double sliders. I haven't tested that, so your mileage may vary.

All configuration of the controller is done *on the controller*. I cannot stress enough that this is a *GOOD* thing. I know I've seen complaints asking for a windows setup tool, but frankly it is simply unnecessary. The on-board menus aren't difficult, people, and having an external tool not only makes it difficult for console players to adjust their settings, it can be a slippery slope where you end up with settings that can *only* be adjusted via the external tool. Please, keep it all on-controller, as it is. 

## What's in the box?
If you buy a DIVA Pro, you get a pretty meh-quality USB-C cable, I haven't measured the length but it's nothing special. A tiny bit shorter than I'd like, but it works fine for me playing at my PC, so not a big deal. You also get some rubber feet (which I haven't installed, because my desk mat holds the controller in place) and most importantly - a spare USB-C input board.

I really want to go out of my way to commend this move, because including a spare input board in case you damage one or both of the ports is a STELLAR move. I don't know if you can buy them separately in the event that you break your spare, too, but honestly it seems pretty unlikely. **THANK YOU** ZhouSensor for thinking ahead and looking out for your customers with this, it really is appreciated.

I plan on keeping the box for mine because the styrofoam is well fitted to the controller, and in the event I need to put it away for an extended period of time, it's nice to have the original box.

## Purchasing (last section)
So, if you've made it this far and decided you *must* have a DIVA Pro, how can you get one?

The best way is to join the YubiParts discord server (https://discord.gg/HG5pFJ7PCp) and keep an eye on the restock notifications. Tim will announce the day prior the *specific* time that these drop, so you can try and buy one. The batch I got mine from sold out in under a minute, so if you aren't ready when the ball drops, it's safe to say you aren't getting one.

According to Tim, there may be some kind of lottery system in the future to help people get them when the stock is so limited, but I know nothing more about that, as no other details have been revealed just yet. If there are any updates, I'll try to make a note about it in the description (but no promises)

Overall though, just make sure you're fully committed and ready to buy this thing if you want it, and expect to spend on the order of $500 US dollars, give or take. Shipping costs will vary depending on where you are in the world.

## Conclusion
Okay, so this review may have sounded very negative, but I promise you, it's not. It's hard to state in words just how much fun this thing is to play on. I love every single second of it and do not regret my purchase in the slightest. For me, this has made my DualShock 4 completely obsolete for playing DIVA.
If you've never had the chance to play DIVA in the arcade style, check out [Zenius](https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/arcades.php) and see if there's one near you. This game was *designed* to be played with this controller, and it shows. A lot of charting decisions just make a lot more sense when you play with the intended controller.

Charts like Po Pi Po on ExEx and Ievan Polkka on ExEx really shine on an arcade controller to me. So do songs with a lot of holds like Rolling Girl ExEx, where you have to really use every part of your hands to keep your holds while playing. 

Compare that to playing on a controller where you just... press a trigger for holds and quads, and it's not even close. For fun level, arcade wins every time.

I will say, unless you're a dedicated DIVA fan, maybe shy away from jumping straight into a DIVA Pro if you've never played arcade-style before. It's definitely different, and has it's own learning curve associated with it. If you don't have a cabinet near you, then it might be worth pursuing some cheaper alternatives to see if you enjoy the arcade style of play before you commit to half a grand on a single-purpose controller.

## Alternatives
So, to close this out,  what are said alternatives? Well there's a couple that I think are worth mentioning.

### Divaller
Something that often gets brought up regarding the DIVA Pro is the [Divaller](https://www.dj-dao.com/en/divaller). It costs a bit more. Despite that, though, many people I've seen have said it's worse than the DIVA Pro in every way - not to mention it is absolutely massive, and weighs a ton (which means more shipping costs.) Not that this really matters, because it's eternally out of stock, and may even be out of production, so the entire point is moot.

### DIY with real control deck
Another option is importing a real cabinet's control deck and adapting it to work with modern equipment. It *seems* to me like you can buy just the control deck for like $250 or something, but you have to import that. And this is just from my very basic research on Yahoo auctions. There's a high technical burden with this, because as far as I know it is not a simple process to get the real cabinet equipment working on PC for example. While I also briefly considered this route, I can't say I recommend it, you most likely won't come out ahead on cost at the end of the day.

- ~$270 USD

### Official HORI controller
There is an "official" DIVA arcade-style controller made by HORI. These come in PS4 and Switch variants, but they are made in very limited supply and often scalped like crazy - this one on ebay is over $500 and I've seen them as high as $800. I don't know much else about these, other than that you can get analog sliders with them via an in-game setting. But, the price is most likely not worth it.

### IPEGA Mini
Last but not least is the IPEGA Mini controller. These are pretty cheap, you can get them for like $60-100 as far as I can tell. I have no experience with these, but based on hisokee's and tokaku's reviews, the buttons are okay but the slider is somewhat unresponsive. That's a dealbreaker for me, personally, but I could see this controller being a good option if you just want to dip your toes into the arcade experience without breaking the bank. These would probably be fine for medium level play, but would fall apart on difficult charts with heavy sliders like Po Pi Po for example. If you buy one of these and like it, but find yourself wanting more, then I think it's fair to consider getting a DIVA Pro.

## Conclusion 2
Anyway, I think that's about all I had to say about the DIVA Pro. Hopefully this video helps you make an informed decision. Feel free to ask questions in the comments and I'll try to answer them best I can. I'm going to now leave this video with me being bad at Project DIVA, goodbye!
